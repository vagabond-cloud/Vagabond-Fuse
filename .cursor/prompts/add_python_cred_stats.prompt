Goal: extend Python Credential-Hub with /stats endpoint.

Tasks:
1. In services/credential-hub:
   - Add route GET /stats returning JSON { issued, verified, revoked }.
   - Pull data from ClickHouse via `clickhouse-connect` async driver.
2. Write Pytest covering happy path + ClickHouse failure fallback.
3. Update OpenAPI docs (`fastapi.openapi_url`).
