Objective: integrate OPA WASM into Python policy-engine.

Steps:
1. Compile sample GDPR rule (rego) → wasm, commit to services/policy-engine/opa/.
2. In `policy_engine/evaluator.py` implement evaluate_credential(input_json) → { allow, reasons } by loading WASM with wasmtime.
3. Migrate JSON-Logic test vectors from TS to Pytest parametrised cases.
4. Achieve ≥ 90 % Py coverage, no TS coverage drop.
