Goal: scaffold the hybrid monorepo.

Tasks (TypeScript):
1. Under packages/ create:
   - wallet-kit/  (React-Native + WASM key store)
   - did-gateway/ (method-agnostic CRUD; start with did:ion & did:polygon)
   - policy-utils/ (JSON-Logic helpers that compile to Rego WASM)

Tasks (Python):
2. Under services/ create:
   - credential-hub/ (FastAPI, SnarkJS via node subprocess, Poetry)
   - policy-engine/  (FastAPI, OPA WASM execution)

General:
- Each package/service has placeholder unit tests (Jest or Pytest).
- Lint, test, build must pass via `pnpm test`.
- Respect /packages vs /services boundary defined in rules.
