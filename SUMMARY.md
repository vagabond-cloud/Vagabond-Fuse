# Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Created a Wallet Adapter Interface**

   - Defined `WalletAdapter` interface in `packages/wallet-kit/src/lib/wallet-adapter.ts`
   - Extended the base `WalletInterface` with XRPL-specific functionality
   - Added methods for connecting to wallets, signing transactions, and submitting to the XRPL

2. **Implemented Default Xumm Adapter**

   - Created `packages/wallet-kit/adapters/xumm/index.ts` implementing the `WalletAdapter` interface
   - Added support for Xumm wallet connection, signing, and transaction submission

3. **Implemented Ledger Hardware Wallet Adapter**

   - Created `packages/wallet-kit/adapters/ledger/index.ts` implementing the `WalletAdapter` interface
   - Added support for Ledger device connection via WebUSB
   - Implemented transaction signing and submission for XRPL

4. **Updated XRPL DID Driver**

   - Modified `packages/did-gateway/src/methods/xrpl.ts` to accept a wallet adapter
   - Added wallet adapter support to all DID operations (create, update, deactivate)
   - Maintained backward compatibility with private key-based operations

5. **Added Unit Tests**

   - Created tests for the Ledger adapter in `packages/wallet-kit/adapters/ledger/__tests__/index.test.ts`
   - Updated XRPL driver tests to cover wallet adapter functionality

6. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added "Bring-your-own-wallet" instructions in `packages/wallet-kit/adapters/README.md`
   - Updated the main DID Gateway README with wallet adapter usage examples
   - Documented the new API methods for wallet adapter integration

## Next Steps

1. **Package Dependencies**

   - Add the required dependencies to package.json:
     - `xumm-sdk` for the Xumm adapter
     - `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb` for the Ledger adapter
     - `@types/node` for Buffer usage

2. **Test Coverage**

   - Ensure test coverage meets the â‰¥ 90% requirement
   - Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases

3. **Integration Testing**

   - Test the wallet adapters with actual XRPL transactions on testnet
   - Verify end-to-end functionality with real wallets

4. **Additional Adapters**
   - Consider adding more wallet adapters (e.g., browser extensions, mobile wallets)
   - Create an adapter factory for easier wallet selection
