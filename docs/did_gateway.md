# DID Gateway

## Introduction

Welcome to the FuseStream DID Gateway documentation. This guide explains how our platform implements a universal gateway for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that enables seamless interaction between different DID methods, blockchain networks, and identity systems. Our DID Gateway provides a unified interface for DID resolution, verification, and management while maintaining high security standards and interoperability.

## Description

The DID Gateway in the FuseStream ecosystem enables:

- Universal DID resolution across multiple methods
- Cross-chain identity verification
- DID method translation and conversion
- Real-time DID status monitoring
- Integration with verifiable credentials
- Compliance with W3C DID standards
- Support for multiple blockchain networks

Our implementation follows W3C DID Core specifications and supports various DID methods including did:ethr, did:key, did:web, and custom methods.

## Overview

This guide covers the architecture, implementation, and usage of our DID Gateway. You'll learn how to resolve, verify, and manage DIDs across different networks and methods while maintaining security and compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before working with the DID Gateway, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18+ or Go 1.22+ installed
- Access to our DID Gateway Service endpoints
- Required environment variables:
  - `DID_GATEWAY_URL`: The base URL for our DID gateway service
  - `DID_GATEWAY_API_KEY`: Your authentication key for the service
- Understanding of DID concepts and blockchain networks

## Supported DID Methods

Our platform supports the following DID methods:

1. **Blockchain-Based Methods**

   - did:ethr (Ethereum)
   - did:polygon (Polygon)
   - did:sol (Solana)
   - Best for: Web3 applications

2. **Key-Based Methods**

   - did:key
   - did:peer
   - Best for: Off-chain identity

3. **Web-Based Methods**

   - did:web
   - did:https
   - Best for: Traditional web apps

4. **Custom Methods**
   - did:fuse (Platform-specific)
   - did:spark (Creator-specific)
   - Best for: Platform features

## Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript
interface DIDGateway {
  // Gateway metadata
  id: string;
  version: string;
  supportedMethods: string[];

  // Gateway configuration
  config: {
    networks: {
      [key: string]: {
        rpc: string;
        chainId: number;
        registry: string;
      };
    };
    resolvers: {
      [key: string]: {
        type: string;
        priority: number;
        options: any;
      };
    };
    cache: {
      enabled: boolean;
      ttl: number;
    };
  };

  // Gateway state
  state: {
    activeConnections: number;
    lastSync: string;
    health: {
      status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
      metrics: {
        latency: number;
        successRate: number;
        errorRate: number;
      };
    };
  };

  // Gateway metadata
  metadata: {
    created: string;
    updated: string;
    status: 'active' | 'maintenance' | 'deprecated';
    tags: string[];
  };
}
```

## Implementation

### DID Resolution

```typescript
import { DIDGatewayClient } from '@fuse/did-gateway-sdk';

const client = new DIDGatewayClient({
  serviceUrl: process.env.DID_GATEWAY_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.DID_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
});

async function resolveDID(did) {
  try {
    const resolution = await client.resolve({
      did,
      options: {
        accept: 'application/did+json',
        cache: true,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
    });

    return resolution;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to resolve DID:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### DID Verification

```typescript
async function verifyDID(did, proof) {
  try {
    const verification = await client.verify({
      did,
      proof,
      options: {
        checkRevocation: true,
        checkExpiration: true,
      },
    });

    return verification;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to verify DID:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Cross-Chain Resolution

```typescript
async function resolveCrossChain(did, targetChain) {
  try {
    const resolution = await client.resolveCrossChain({
      did,
      targetChain,
      options: {
        bridge: 'auto',
        timeout: 10000,
      },
    });

    return resolution;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to resolve cross-chain:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Method Translation

```typescript
async function translateDID(did, targetMethod) {
  try {
    const translation = await client.translate({
      did,
      targetMethod,
      options: {
        preserveKeys: true,
        validate: true,
      },
    });

    return translation;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to translate DID:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Security Features

### DID Authentication

```typescript
async function authenticateDID(did, challenge) {
  try {
    const auth = await client.authenticate({
      did,
      challenge,
      options: {
        proofType: 'Ed25519Signature2020',
        domain: 'fuse.stream',
      },
    });

    return auth;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to authenticate DID:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Key Rotation

```typescript
async function rotateKeys(did, newKeys) {
  try {
    const rotation = await client.rotateKeys({
      did,
      newKeys,
      options: {
        revokeOld: true,
        updateRegistry: true,
      },
    });

    return rotation;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to rotate keys:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Features

### Health Checks

```typescript
async function checkGatewayHealth() {
  try {
    const health = await client.checkHealth({
      options: {
        detailed: true,
        includeMetrics: true,
      },
    });

    return health;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to check gateway health:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
async function monitorPerformance() {
  try {
    const metrics = await client.getMetrics({
      options: {
        period: '1h',
        includeDetails: true,
      },
    });

    return metrics;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get performance metrics:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
