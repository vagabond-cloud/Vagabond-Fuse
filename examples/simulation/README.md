# EU Digital ID Wallet Simulation

This simulation demonstrates how the Vagabond-Fuse framework can be used to implement the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI) for cross-border public services.

## Overview

The simulation is based on the scenario shown in the image:

1. Alma, a 29-year-old Spanish citizen living in Portugal, needs to update her address in the Portuguese National Population Register.
2. She opens the Portuguese National Population Register app.
3. She authenticates with her Spanish identification information from her EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI).
4. Her address is updated in the Portuguese National Population Register.

## Technical Implementation

The simulation uses:

- XRPL testnet for DID (Decentralized Identifier) operations
- Verifiable Credentials for the Spanish identification document
- Mock services for the Portuguese National Population Register

## Components

1. **EUDIWallet**: A mock implementation of an EU Digital Identity Wallet that can:

   - Connect to the XRPL testnet
   - Manage the user's DID
   - Store and present verifiable credentials

2. **XrplDID**: A representation of a DID document on the XRPL blockchain

3. **SpanishIdentificationAuthority**: A mock issuer of Spanish identification credentials

4. **PopulationRegisterService**: A mock service representing the Portuguese National Population Register

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation:

```bash
# Make sure you have Node.js and the required dependencies installed
npm install xrpl

# Run the simulation
npx ts-node examples/simulation/eu_digital_id_simulation.ts
```

## Expected Output

The simulation will output a step-by-step process showing:

1. Alma opening her EUDI wallet
2. Creation of her digital identity (DID)
3. The Spanish authority issuing her identification credential
4. Alma opening the Portuguese National Population Register app
5. Authentication with her Spanish identification
6. Updating her address in the Portuguese system

## Benefits of EU Digital ID Wallet

- **Seamless Cross-Border Services**: Citizens can access public services across EU member states without bureaucratic hurdles.
- **Secure Identity Verification**: Cryptographically secure verification of identity without revealing unnecessary personal data.
- **User Control**: Citizens maintain control over their identity data and choose what to share.
- **Paperless Procedures**: Reduces the need for physical documents and in-person visits to government offices.

## Integration with Vagabond-Fuse

This simulation demonstrates how the Vagabond-Fuse framework's components can be used to implement the EUDI wallet:

- **DID Gateway**: For creating and managing decentralized identifiers
- **Wallet Kit**: For secure key management and signing operations
- **Credential Hub**: For issuing and verifying credentials
- **Policy Engine**: For enforcing access control policies

In a production implementation, these components would be fully integrated with the XRPL and other blockchain networks to provide a secure and interoperable digital identity solution.
